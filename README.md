# Contacts Are Lit

This code was written by Niv Ben-Porath


Contacts list Screen
* The list is shown in a collection view (I wanted a different appearance than the traditional table view)
* The collection view is updated via Diffable Data Source (ios13+)
* Each cell shows only the image and name

Add Contact Screen
* A placeholder image is shown at the top with an option to select an image
* User can enter name, phone and email in the relevant fields

*Show Contact info
* Shows the contact name, phone, email and image 
* User can make a phone call from this screen
* User can edit the info
* User can delete the contact after verifying the delete


Known issues and bugs
* error messages should be displayed to the user. Currently they are only printed
* there should be an option for validating phone and email
* need to add an option to take a picture with the camera


Notes:
* UI is implemented in code
